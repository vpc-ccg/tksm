  * Noise
  * PCR errors
    * Several PCR settings and cycle counts

## RNA

* Poly-A size distributions
* Expression
  * PCR
* cDNA vs direct RNA comparison

## Chimeric read characteristics

* Readthrough
* Fusion
* Random pairing

## Single cell characteristics

* Novel Single Cell dataset from matrix
